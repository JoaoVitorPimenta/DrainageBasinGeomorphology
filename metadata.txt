description=This plugin provides tools for geomorphological analysis in drainage basins.
version=1.2.2
author=João Vitor Pimenta
email=jvpjoaopimenta@gmail.com

about=Studying and analyzing the geomorphology of drainage basins is essential to understand the dynamics of the processes that occur in them and their interactions with the environment and human activities. In this context, the "Drainage Basin Geomorphology" plugin aims to provide tools that help the user to quickly analyze characteristics of the drainage basin. If you have any questions, suggestions, errors or need information/training about the plugin, please contact: jvpjoaopimentadev@gmail.com

        1.2.2
        -change the order for ranking parameters and Compound Value, with my tests, this don't affect final result of ranking, but its more accurated with bibliography

        1.2.1
        -now the plugin works correctly with interbasins
        -add more information in .csv of priority tools

        1.2.0
        -add High, Medium and Low priority classification in basins rankeds
        -now its compatible with QGIS 4
        -now the plugin versioning use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH standard

        1.1
        -add basin modification tools

        0.9
        -add exception if the channels forms a loop
        -change the name and the information about "Snap channel tolerance" (now its named "channel coordinate precision") and now its a optional input

        0.8
        -now the streams no longer need to be entirely in the basin, the plugin will use the part of the streams that intersect the basin
        -the input "Snap channel tolerance" is added in case of basins/channels with problematic geometries

        0.7
